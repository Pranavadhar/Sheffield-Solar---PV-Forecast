This project employs LSTM networks to validate PV forecast, utilizing a one-year past dataset scrapped
from their website to predict future movements and to integrate solar energy in an efficient way. Preprocessed
historical data to train LSTM models for solar energy prediction. Developed a forecasting model
to assist in efficient solar energy integration.
